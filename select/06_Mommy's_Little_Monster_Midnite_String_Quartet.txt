Mommy's little monster dropped out of school
Mommy's little monster broke all the rules
He loves to go out drinking with the boys
He loves to go out and make some noise

He doesn't wanna be a doctor
Or a lawyer, get fat and rich
He's twenty years old, he quit his job
Unemployment pays his rent

His brothers and sisters
Have tasted sweet success
His parents condemn him
Say 'His life's a mess'

He's mommy's little monster
He's not afraid to admit
He's mommy's little monster
Don't wake him in a fit

Mommy's little monster shoots Methedrine
Mommy's little monster had sex at fifteen
She left home for the streets
She couldn't deal with all that heat

She had fun with the boys in the band
In her eyes it will never end
Her dad asked what happened to her face
It could have happened in any place

Her eyes are a deeper blue
She likes to have that color too
She can't even wear a dress
But that doesn't mean she'll ever confess

She's mommy's little monster
She's mommy's little monster
She's mommy's little monster
Don't take her life away

Her eyes are a deeper blue
She likes to have that color too
She can't even wear a dress
But that doesn't mean she'll ever confess

Mommy's little monster
She's mommy's little monster
Mommy's little monster
Don't take her life away

She's mommy's little monster
She's mommy's little monster
She's mommy's little monster
She's mommy's little monster
